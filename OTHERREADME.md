# Model of the Soccer Prediction app
The app returns the expected result (rounded) and the probability of each possible outcome given the guess of the user, the certainty of his/her guess and the results of the Bundesliga matches of the season 2010/11 until 2016/17. Let $a$ be the number of goals of the home team $\mathcal{A}$ and $b$ the number of goals of the guest $\mathcal{B}$. As underlying probability distribution I assumed
$$
P(a,b|\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})=P_\text{m}(a,b|\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})(1-p_\text{c})+P_\text{u}p_\text{c}
$$
\begin{equation*}
A=B+C
\end{equation*}
